RandomBits
==========

This Repo consists of exactly what it says: 'random bits' of code. This might include my weekend projects, 
various contst solutions (only after the contests are over), prototypes that might evolve into something bigger later on etc.
My effort will be to check-in the code in as good shape as possible. All the code is free to use in any manner whatsoever.
If you want to be nice to me, credit me if you use the code.
